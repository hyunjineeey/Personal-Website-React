            I believe that coding can change the world. There are many things that can be improved with coding. From small inconveniences to how an entire task is performed. Letâ€™s suppose you have some inconveniences in your life and you want to make it better. Coding can fix it. All you need is a computer. You can make a program whenever or wherever you like, such as cafes, parks, even in your dorm. I believe through a completed program, one may receive great help in their daily lives and through this help they could live a happier life. Isn't it cool to contribute to someone's life? I'm putting a lot of energy into coding so that someone can live a better life.
