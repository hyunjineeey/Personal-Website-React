  "code": {
    "question": "Why do you code?",
    "answer": "I believe that coding can change the world. There are many things that can be improved with coding. From small inconveniences to how an entire task is performed. Let's suppose you have some inconveniences in your life and you want to make it better. Coding can fix it. All you need is a computer. You can make a program whenever or wherever you like, such as cafes, parks, even in your dorm. I believe through a completed program, one may receive great help in their daily lives and through this help they could live a happier life. <1>Isn't it cool to contribute to someone's life?</1> I'm putting a lot of energy into coding so that someone can live a better life."

  "hobby": {
    "question": "How do you spend your free time?",
    "answer": "It might sound clichÃ©, but I like to read <1>books</1> and write in my spare time. Reading and writing help clear my mind. When I read, it feels like the words are talking to me and I'm communicating with the author. When I write something down about my feelings or emotions, I'm facing myself and I really enjoy the time. I'm also interested in creating videos so I capture my daily life and edit videos. I like learning new things from a completely different world and a few weeks ago (as of 12-30-2022), I registered for a hip-hop dance class! Who knows if I will become a k-pop dancer??ðŸ¤­"
